# Desktop host

An isolated Extension Development Host window, loading the extension straight from `packages/vscode`.
Uses `REPO`, `SKILL`, `RUN`, `PORT` and `cdp` from step 1 of `SKILL.md`.

## Launch

Run this in the background; it keeps running until the close step below.

```bash
code --new-window --disable-workspace-trust --skip-welcome --skip-release-notes \
  --disable-extensions \
  --user-data-dir="$RUN/profile" --extensions-dir="$RUN/ext" \
  --extensionDevelopmentPath="$REPO/packages/vscode" \
  --remote-debugging-port=$PORT "$RUN/ws"
```

- `--extensionDevelopmentPath` must be absolute. A relative one is silently ignored: the window opens with no spek icon in the activity bar and no `spek:` commands.
- The throwaway `--user-data-dir` keeps the operator's own VS Code untouched and makes this window an instance of its own. A launch sharing a running instance's profile starts no instance: its window opens inside the running one and its `--remote-debugging-port` is ignored, so nothing answers on `$PORT` (measured with two launches sharing a throwaway profile, standing in for the default one; VS Code 1.140, Linux, 2026-10-06).
- `--disable-extensions` disables installed extensions only; the development extension still loads. The "All installed extensions are temporarily disabled" toast is expected.
- The `code` launcher may exit while the window stays up; the window is what matters.
- A window opens on the operator's screen. Say so before launching.

Wait for the workbench, then list the targets:

```bash
until cdp workbench '"up"' 2>/dev/null; do sleep 1; done; sleep 4
cdp targets
```

## Close

```bash
cdp close
```

This sends the DevTools `Browser.close` command to the instance serving `$PORT`, which shuts down exactly that window, waits for its connection to drop, then waits up to 30 seconds for nothing to listen on the port.
Do not kill it instead.
The `code` launcher exits once the window is up, and the window's main process is reparented (parent PID 1), so the PID a script started is not the window's.
A pattern kill (`pkill -f` on the profile path) also matches the window's GPU and utility processes, and in four runs the window survived the first SIGTERM three times; why was not established.
(Both measured on VS Code 1.140, Linux, 2026-10-06.)
A pattern kill can also match the shell running it, whose own command line holds the pattern: `pkill -f "serve-web --port 8123"` killed the shell that ran it (observed 2026-10-06).

If it fails with "window closed; port … accepts connections and never answers", the window is gone but a process outside VS Code still held the DevTools socket after those 30 seconds, and the next launch on that port will fail.
On Ubuntu 20.04 (GNOME on X11, VS Code 1.134) that was a `dconf watch /system/proxy/` started alongside the window and reparented to `systemd --user`; `ss -ltnp | grep :$PORT` named it, and stopping that one process freed the port (reported by another operator; it did not happen on GNOME Shell 51 on Arch, Wayland, VS Code 1.141, 2026-10-08).
Before this check, `close` waited on that port with no timeout and never returned.
