// A spec topic is the slash-separated directory path of a `spec.md` relative to its `specs/` root:
// `auth`, `contracts/pagination`, `contracts/pagination/streaming-search`. This module holds the rules
// about that string that every surface shares — which strings are topics at all, how they order, how one
// is shown and linked, and how a flat list becomes a folder tree.
//
// Pure logic with no runtime import, so it ships as the `@spekjs/core/spec-topic` subpath and can be
// value-imported from a browser bundle, the same arrangement as headings.ts. The Kotlin mirror of the
// validators is SpecTopic.kt.

// A segment never begins with `.` (which also rules out `.` and `..`): discovery skips dot-entries, so a
// dotted segment names nothing the list shows. No separator of either kind, no NUL, no control character
// — the last is what refuses `auth\n`.
